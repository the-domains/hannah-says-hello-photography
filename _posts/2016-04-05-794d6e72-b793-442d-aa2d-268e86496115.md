based in colorado.  
frequently traveling.  
twenty-something.  
chasing the light.

my favorite things in the world are the stories that faces tell, words that make you feel something deep inside, and the ways that we can love other people.

i change my hair color frequently

i love a really good vanilla latte. 

mountains are my favorite landscape.

i always have music in my ears.  
i want to spend my whole life laughing.

let's be friends.
